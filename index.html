        <p>Hi, I am Reggie and I live in Alpharetta GA with my husband,
            4 crazy boys and a puppy. My favorite hobby is creating arts and crafts.
            Some projects I did include pottery, crochet, painting, scrapbooking,
            wood working and more. I am a student in the master program for Web design
            and Online communication. This is my forth semester in the program,
            having fun learning JavaScript. Trying to study with 4 bored kids at home
            is not an easy task! There is quite a difference between how I'd like to
            imagine myself and the way I really feel sometimes...
        </p>
