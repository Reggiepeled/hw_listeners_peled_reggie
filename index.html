    <h1>Reggie Peled</h1>
    <p>Hi, I am Reggie and I live in Alpharetta GA with my husband,
        4 crazy boys and a puppy. My favorite hobby is creating arts and crafts.
        Some projects I did include pottery, crochet, painting, scrapbooking,
        wood working and more. I am a student in the master program for Web design
        and Online communication. This is my forth semester in the program,
        having fun learning JavaScript. Trying to study with 4 bored kids at home
        is not an easy task! There is quite a difference between how I'd like to
        imagine myself and the way I really feel sometimes...
    </p>
